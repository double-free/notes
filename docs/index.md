# Ye's Notes

Notes for my random readings. There's no explicit goal, but I'd love to keep my brain busy.

The notes can be roughly split to 3 topics, they are related to my work to varying degrees:

- Trading

- Computer science

- Mathematics

Again, I'm not an expert in any of these areas, sorry for any error or incompleteness, and appreciate if you can point them out.
